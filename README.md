### Troubleshooting:
* If your Switch won't boot, or crashes after updating with these files, delete the `Atmosphere` folder on the root of your SD card, and re-copy everything on to your SD card. 
* For a specific Homebrew or app not working, check with the developer of that app, or check the relevent thread on GBAtemp.net.
* For anything else, feel free to message me on Discord at `Nack#0404`
